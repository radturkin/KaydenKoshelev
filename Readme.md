<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This was built for a client, I wanted to create a simple portfolio site for performers, that didn't utilize the common and redundant templates,
but instead build something simple, that could showcase and express the personality of each individual client, whie being as lite as possible.
I love finding ways of doing more with less, continually simplifying without loss of functionality, and improving load speed.
The client was very happy, and in such a competitive profession appreciated a site that stood out from others, whlie being tidy, to the point, 
and easily accessible to casting directors and other professionals.

### Built With

This site was a simple build of just CSS and HTML, I might utilize frameworks for future clients, but I wanted to create something as simply as possible, 
while I enjoy making money, I want to make sure that should I ever become unavailable to a client that I be able to pass their portfolio on to someone else, 
who could easily maintain it with too much of a learning curve.

* CSS
* HTML
