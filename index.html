        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born
            in Burbank, CA and then raised in the Chicagoland area, Kayden fell in love
            with acting and performing at a very young age. Kayden is a gifted student who
            also enjoys math, chess, art and coding. He loves a good video game, art tutorials
            and is currently geeking out on D&D! He spent a few years on a competitive
            dance and musical theatre troupe and loved being part of Second City's Youth
            Troupe (Chicago). He's grateful for the amazing teams at Paonessa Talent
            Agency, CESD and Brave Artists Management, whose support has allowed him to
            pursue his dreams!

            <p><strong>TV/Film
            Career</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>Kayden discovered his
            passion for acting at a young age, debuting in his first television show at the
            age of 7, acting alongside Terry O'Quinn in Amazon's Patriot. Following that
            role, Kayden took a very emotional turn as a sick child with an unstable father
            in Chicago Med before appearing alongside William H. Macy in Shameless. In
            2020, he worked with Director Joel Coen in The Tragedy of Macbeth, appearing as
            one of the apparitions who haunt Denzel Washington's Macbeth. After landing a
            Co-Star role in Diary of a Future President for Disney+, Kayden landed his
            first recurring role as Aspen on Search Party for HBO Max. You can hear
            Kayden's pipes in Netflix's Me Time, as he sings a stirring rendition of
            "Hallelujah" in a scene alongside Kevin Hart. Kayden's first horror
            film, Grimcutty, is streaming on HULU. Other recent Guest Star roles include Bunk'd, 
            How I Met Your Father, Night Court, and 911: Lone Star. 
            Kayden also worked on Rebel Moon, directed
            by Zach Snyder, set to release on Netflix in December of 2023.

            school and on stage! He booked his first professional
            Musical Theatre Production at age 7 in Seussical, and by age 10 he played the
            lead role of Oliver in the Marriott Theatre stage's Oliver! In 2020, Kayden
            joined Second City's Youth Ensemble. In Hollywood, he performed with Blackout+
            Improv (an adult Sketch/Improv Troupe) at Pack Theater before landing the heart-warming 
            role of Brendan in Drag: The Musical directed by Spencer Liff. It ran at The Bourbon
            Room in Hollywood receiving amazing reviews and the attention of many
            celebrities who came out to see the show. His current shows to round out his 2023 include playing Oliver in Oliver!
            with 5-Star Theatricals, running at the Fred Kavli Theatre (Bank of America
